# Robotic_QR_Instruction_System

This project focuses on developing a robotic system
capable of scanning QR codes and barcodes to execute embedded
instructions, enhancing its adaptability in dynamic environments.
The process involves integrating a SparkFun 2D Barcode Scanner
Breakout with the robot and programming a development board
to translate scanned data into actionable tasks like movement,
LCD control, or sound generation. The expected outcome is a
robot capable of real-time task reconfiguration through QR and
barcode interpretation.
